## Week 5

### Monday-Oct 10
  Day off!


  
 ### Wednesday-Oct 12
  We tested out the prototype reflector for the first time today. The water ended up not coming to a boil over the course of an hour, which could have been due to numerous factors including the cloudiness, need to adjust the reflector, and imperfect focusing of the light.

  At the end of class, Catherine and I discussed how to move our solar tracking tool that was originally on a breadboard to a smaller PCB, and I ended up coming into shop on Sunday to finish up the second half of it when Catherine had finished soldering the first half of the components to the PCB. There were a lot of challenges with soldering because of the compactness of the board and how many components had to be connected right next to each other. I also tried to make the photoresistors as level as possible with the PCB, but it ended up being impossible because the dimensions of the wire were difficult to get around and was not perfectly symmetrical when placed in a three row configuration. Overall, the soldering process was pretty tedious because I was trying to make the wires as short as possible.
