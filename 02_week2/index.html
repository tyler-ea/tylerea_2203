### Week 2 

## Monday
  	
In Mondayâ€™s class, we split up into groups for the first time and started to brainstorm alternative designs for the projects we were assigned to. I worked with the thermal storage group to devise some alternatives to the current thermal storage design that was used last year, and among the problems that we talked about, the main focus of our time was with the contact problem with the gap of air present when the salt liquifies. We decided on a design that will have some additional volume at the top such that most of the top surface has contact with the molten salt. We also discussed ways to handle the block, but we did not reach a satisfactory agreement.
	
  
  ## Wednesday
  In Wednesday's class, we helped to assemble some solar cookers that have varying degrees of effectiveness and assembly difficulty in an attempt to learn from commercial models. I personally helped with the box design that had large sides with reflective coating. We found that the smaller cooker ended up warming the water that we used faster (thus concentrating solar energy more efficiently), and the box-type was not as effective. We used the Flir Camera device to exmaine the regions of heat concentration and also thermocouple probes to detect the changes within the water temperature. Overall, it was a relatively uneventful class, but we learned a lot about how strange current commercial designs are.
