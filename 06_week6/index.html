## Week 6

### Monday-Oct 17
  We worked on some CAD stuff in Fusion 360 with Justin guiding us through some basic features. I found a lot of difficulty with managing some of the constraint conditions and the normal lines, which I plan on playing around with more as I start using Fusion more.


  
 ### Wednesday-Oct 19
  I was a part of the group that was working on the solar tracking component of the prototype alongside Catherine and Christine. First, we made a crucible using cardboard and a hot glue gun to stick it onto the board that we had made. We then proceeded to attach longer wires so that the board could reach the Arduino microcontroller itself, and this process took a while because we tried simply twisting the metal together. Eventually, I took on the job of soldering the wires together. We then mounted the board onto the motor component, but after wiring everything together, we realized that there was a short in our circuit and the photoresistors did not work properly at all. Nathan then tried to clean it up, and we tested again to no avail. After this disaster, Catherine and I planned to work on a newer PCB this weekend, and I came in on Friday to do about half of it.
